# Exercise-06C-Dialog

# References

Textures from: https://freepbr.com/
Models and animations from: Mixamo.com

In this final assignment, I hope to make a 3D RPG type game. The game type referenced is a large free exploration game. So focus on building a more free and complete scene. Made enemies and some animations.
The external goal is to increase the sense of gameplay, such as being able to be killed, or dropping items after killing enemies.

Try to make something more difficult and more interesting to play. Enemies are chasing players. Try setting up ink and the dialog box. Added reward mechanism and score mechanism.
The next step is to enter a new game after obtaining enough points.
